# Bomberman: Bocchi the Rock Edition

This is a single-player Bomberman-like game developed using C++ and the Allegro 5 game library, inspired by the popular anime *Bocchi the Rock!*.

Players control members of the "Kessoku Band," using their instruments as bombs to color the stage with their territory. When time runs out, the player who has covered the largest area wins!

* **Multiplayer Battles**: Supports 1 or 2 players competing against AI-controlled opponents.
* **Varied Maps**: Includes three themed maps: School, STARRY live house, and Bocchi's Room.
* **Dynamic Environments**: Some obstacles on the map can be destroyed and may drop power-up items.
* **High Risk, High Reward**: Beware! If you're caught in an explosion — even your own — your captured territory will reset to zero!
